- **Booking System:** Facilitates users to make bookings for selected accommodations within available dates.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal viewing and interaction experience across devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** Database to store accommodation, user, and booking information.
- **Express.js:** Backend framework to handle server-side operations and API routes.
- **React.js:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
